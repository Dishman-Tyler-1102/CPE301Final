Our project was to build and code an Arduino circuit that contained a temperature and humidity sensor, a water sensor, a vent with a motor to open and close it, with button controls, a motor with a fan attached, an LCD display for readings, a real-time clock, and LEDs which display a different color for each of the four different states that the circuit can be in. This is also displayed, with the time, in the serial monitor. 

We initially began this project by creating the GitHub and adding code from previous labs that we were familiar with. This was mostly to initialize registers and pins for things such as the ADC, UART, LCD, the lights, and the buttons. After compiling some of the necessary code in one place, we met up together to assemble the circuit, and work on some harder parts of the code. This was where we figured out the state changes, the sensors, and the display. We separately worked on pieces of the circuit as well, like the interrupts and the real-time clock module. A lot of this process consisted of individually testing pieces of the final circuit, before adding it to the complete thing.
